# Computational-Geometry
Repository for hosting project of Computional Geometry 

**Computational Geometry Project**

The project is to determine the intersection points of segments with remote endpoints or their common parts if the segments overlap to any degree.

Once the calculation is done, visualization of the results is necessary.
